","I found that I was more prone to select paintings where the subject was not making eye contact.

Then, and I do not know why, I continued with a belief that the pairings were more likely than not, to have a balanced outcome. That is, if one painting was not profitable, then the alternative option must have been profitable. Thus, if my selection was not profitable, then my alternative choice must have been profitable. With this,  I then attempted to extrapolate a pattern of profitable  pairs, or pairings that a clear winner could be guessed. For example, the lady with two kids on chairs paired with the homeless man outside sleeping near a fire. I concluded that a picture of a family unit was more profitable than a single man.
