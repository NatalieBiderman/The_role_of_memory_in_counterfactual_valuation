lH7WI,33,Enthusiast,10,There was nothing in the instructions that I found unclear. ,Right,4,Male,Yes,I did my best to remember which pictures sold well at auction. I thought about the characteristics of the pieces that didn't sell well. I concluded that people didn't like pictures of people who seemed to be depressed or brooding. They seemed to want to purchase pictures with brighter colors and happier people. I focused on selecting those types of pictures. ,I really relied on intuition more than anything else in the beginning of the study. I just chose which paintings seemed to speak to my soul and moved me. I thought that my personal preference for complex and troubled characters would be shared the art buyers. I just tried to appreciate the most complex paintings that I saw. ,I tried to find a happy medium between my personal preference and what the art buyers liked. I chose to lean about 80% into what the art buyers wanted and keep 20% of my selections to what I liked. That means most of the paintings I picked were brighter and had very unique themes. A smaller portion were darker and more intimate. ,I decided to stick to the paintings that I had been show previously. I wanted to be loyal to the paintings that I was familiar with. I thought I had a better chance of receiving a higher monetary value for the painting if I was familiar with how it was judged already. I didn't want to chance the unknown. ,Pilot
